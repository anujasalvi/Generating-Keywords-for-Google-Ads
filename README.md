# Digital Marketing Campaign Prototype: Furniture Keywords

This project is a prototype for generating a targeted set of keywords for a major online furniture retailer. The focus is on the **sofas section**, with additional product categories included.

---

## Overview

Our digital marketing agency has been approached to create a large-scale search campaign for a major furniture retailer. The client is a budget-friendly retailer known for regular promotions and discounts. Our task is to generate a list of tightly targeted keywords for the following products:

- **Sofas**
- **Convertible Sofas**
- **Love Seats**
- **Recliners**
- **Sofa Beds**

Given the client's emphasis on affordability and promotions, the campaign will avoid luxury-related keywords. Instead, we will focus on price-sensitive and action-oriented keywords that resonate with cost-conscious consumers.

## Keyword Generation Approach

### Step 1: Identify Core Product Terms
The main products to target are:
- Sofas
- Convertible Sofas
- Love Seats
- Recliners
- Sofa Beds

### Step 2: Generate Supporting Words
Identify words that, when combined with the product terms, form strong keywords. Examples include:
- `buy`
- `prices`
- `sale`
- `discount`
- `cheap`
- `deals`

### Step 3: Formulate Keyword Combinations
Combine the product terms with the supporting words in various orders. For example, using the products _sofas_ and _recliners_ with words like `buy` and `prices` could yield:
- `buy sofas`
- `sofas buy`
- `buy recliners`
- `recliners buy`
- `prices sofas`
- `sofas prices`
- `prices recliners`
- `recliners prices`

This combinatorial approach is applied to all product categories using the chosen supporting words.

## Implementation Details

- **Match Types:**  
  All keywords will be configured as **exact** or **phrase match** to ensure the campaign remains tightly targeted and cost-effective.

- **Budget Considerations:**  
  Given the limited budget, our strategy focuses on a refined set of highly relevant keywords rather than a broad, generic campaign.

- **Campaign Optimization:**  
  The prototype will be tested on a small scale, with performance data used to refine keyword combinations and adjust bid strategies for optimal ROI.

## Usage

1. **Review the Keyword List:**  
   Use the provided combinations as a baseline. Evaluate the relevance of each combination based on further market research and client feedback.

2. **Customize for Each Product:**  
   Apply the same combination logic to each of the listed product categories (sofas, convertible sofas, love seats, recliners, sofa beds) to expand the keyword list.

3. **Test and Iterate:**  
   Launch a small-scale test campaign. Monitor performance, adjust bids, and refine keywords as necessary.
